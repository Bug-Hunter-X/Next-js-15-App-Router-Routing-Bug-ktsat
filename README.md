# Next.js 15 App Router Routing Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential routing issue in Next.js 15's App Router.  The issue involves unexpected behavior when navigating between pages, particularly after using client-side navigation or dynamic routes.

## Bug Description

The core problem is inconsistent or incorrect rendering of pages after navigation. Routes may not update as expected, or the application might transition to an unexpected state.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate between pages. Observe unexpected behavior in page transitions or rendering.

## Potential Causes

* Incorrect usage of the new App Router's routing conventions.
* Conflicts between client-side navigation and server-side rendering.
* Issues related to dynamic routes and route parameters.
* Asynchronous data fetching inconsistencies during navigation.

## Solution

The solution often involves reviewing routing logic to align it correctly with Next.js 15's App Router specifications.  This might include verifying data fetching methods, checking route definitions, and ensuring consistent navigation strategies.
